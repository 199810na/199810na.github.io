      <h1>Fetal Wishing Service Station</h1>
      <p>2020</p>
      <p>Immersive Interactive Installation</p>
      <p>Fetal Wishing Service Station is an immersive interactive installation.
        Inspired by the Fetal Wishing Guanyin in Chinese Buddhism, by creating a
        space to realize the desire to have children, this artwork ironically
        exposes the common oppression of reproduction toward women in society.

        A mobile service station for fetal wishing was created using two dragon
        pillars, a LED advertisement lightbox, two TV screens, a computer, a
        surveillance camera, and religious decorations. When people use four
        religious gestures in the station, the machine learning program
        “Teachable Machine” on the computer recognizes the gestures through the
        camera and plays videos on the TV.

        There are four videos that correspond to four kinds of fertility
        oppressions toward females: pregnancy, abortion, brainwashing, and
        gender regulations. In addition, the missing opponent in the station –
        the statue, reveals that the utilitarian nature of praying and
        worshipping is nothing but the projection of human’s own wishes.</p>
