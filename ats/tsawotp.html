      <h1>There’s A Woman on the Pedestal</h1>
      <p>2023</p>
      <p>Live Performance With Microcontrollers And Electronics</p>
      <p>On the date of International Womens Day, I wear a cheap wedding dress
        and sit on a pedestal in an extremely uncomfortable position, holding a
        machine that represents a pregnant stomach (the name of this machine is
        “mental image”). The audience puts their fingers into the fingertips,
        and the heartbeat sensor will detect the heartbeat of the audience. The
        frequency of the heartbeat will affect the water pump installed in the
        ink bottle so that the ink in the water pump and in the water pipe
        presents a rhythm consistent with the heartbeat of the audience. The
        other end of the water pipe is connected to the machine, and the ink
        drip from top to bottom, through the filter that has a mixture of stone
        powder, deicing salt, sea shell powder, and dust, and drip into the box
        covered with silk paper ( a traditional paper for Chinese ink painting).
        Excess ink that the paper couldn’t hold would stain my wedding dress and
        flow from my stomach to the floor.</p>
