            <p>3D-mapping, Stop-motion Animation</p>
            <p>Female Factory is a 3D projection installation. Stop-motion
                animations are projected on the front and back of three
                black and white TV sets, showing an automated factory that
                seems to solve the workplace discrimination toward women,
                but actually uses women's bodies to produce babies. In this
                process, women need to cycle through the three stages of
                eating, fertility, and aging. This endless loop forms a cage
                that women cannot escape from or breakthrough. </p>
