      <p>Interactive Installation</p>
      <p>Is an artificial intelligence infant a human or a machine? Infant uses
        technology such as machine learning and digital signal processing to
        simulate the four responses of human infants--curiosity and habit,
        comfort and discomfort. The audienceâ€™s recognition of the Infant will
        affect the result of the interaction, and the recognition will be
        presented to the audience instantly from a projected screen. When the
        infant's discomfort reaches a certain level, the infant will cry. There
        are two ways to stop the infant from crying.1. Put the forefinger in the
        heartbeat sensor for 100 seconds, and the infant will gradually stop
        crying;2. Leave the infant crying. After 1000 seconds, the system
        refreshes. The number on the screen represents how many times the system
        has been refreshed. The infant, as the initial stage of life that has
        not yet formed a self-consciousness, has various symbolic meanings in
        art and philosophy. In this work, the infant becomes an identity that
        blurs the digital body and the physical body. When the viewer interacts
        with the infant as a finite being, the viewer feels their own view of
        life from the infant's feedback. How should people redefine life in the
        future world when life is not just about having a physical body and will
        eventually decrease?</p>
